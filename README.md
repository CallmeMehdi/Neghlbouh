We are living in very challenging and decisive times in our country  as the pandemic outbreak continues  we need to take action swiftly and efficiently to limit this spread , even though the government declared a national coronavirus confinement,  a large portion of people still fail to respect this decision for reasons varying from emergency needs to work  requirements to even impertinence and transgression .

To guarantee the safety of people and in order to stop the COVID-19 spread ,we need to limit these movements in a  controlled and managed  fashion in order to avoid  unnecessary social contact and also to track and monitor infected citizens and potential threats .
Our solution solves this very problem. In fact,we ,as active members of IEEE INSAT, suggest a project that helps manage the distribution of people who are in need to leave their premises through a platform that serves as a medium for controlling this movement using a gps tracking bracelet in a simple, intelligent and  efficient way . 
Our project contains two main  components  the platform and the electronic gps bracelet


The basic functionalities of this application are :
- Create an account ( each account is identified by the National Identification Number ): 
- An account for the citizen
- An account for the administrator
- Fill the form to ask for an authorization to go out ( Reason - Destination .. )
- Visualize the distribution of the accepted authorizations
- Accept or refuse the demand by the administrator
- Obtaining the authorization code ( Temporary validation of this code. It expires after a certain time demanded )
- Alerting users in case of a containment break ( If a quarantined person goes out of his authorized zone [ tracked by a bracelet: documented in the second part ] ).
These alerts are sent to the administrators in order to localize and stop the authorizations in that zone.
- Generating statistics of people under control ( with the help of the bracelets ) ( Only an administrator can track the quarantined people with the use of a gps system) .
